This `auth_inmemory` package provides an in-memory implementation of the `AuthClient` interface within the [**Flutter News App Full Source Code Toolkit**](https://github.com/flutter-news-app-full-source-code). It offers a mock authentication client that operates entirely on in-memory data, making it suitable for demonstration purposes, local development, and testing without requiring a live backend. This package simulates various authentication flows, ensuring consistent behavior and robust error handling based on the `auth_client` contract.

## ‚≠ê Feature Showcase: Simplified Authentication Testing & Development

This package offers a comprehensive set of features for managing authentication operations in a simulated environment.

<summary><strong>üß± Core Functionality</strong></summary>

### üöÄ `AuthClient` Implementation
- **`AuthInmemory` Class:** A concrete in-memory implementation of the `AuthClient` interface, providing a standardized way to simulate authentication.
- **Simulated Authentication Flows:** Implements `requestSignInCode`, `verifySignInCode`, `signInAnonymously`, and `signOut` to simulate various authentication processes.
- **Reactive State Changes:** Provides `authStateChanges` (a stream that emits the current authenticated `User` or `null` on state changes) and `getCurrentUser` to retrieve the current user.

### üåê Debugging & Validation
- **Privileged Flow Simulation:** Supports an `isDashboardLogin` flag in `requestSignInCode` and `verifySignInCode` to simulate privileged flows, allowing testing of admin-specific authentication logic (e.g., only `admin@example.com` is allowed).
- **Token Retrieval:** Includes a `currentToken` getter to retrieve the simulated authentication token for inspection during development.

### üõ°Ô∏è Standardized Error Handling
- **`HttpException` Propagation:** Throws standard `HttpException` subtypes (e.g., `UnauthorizedException`, `NotFoundException`, `AuthenticationException`, `InvalidInputException`) from `core` on simulated failures, ensuring consistent error handling in a testing context.

> **üí° Your Advantage:** This package provides a reliable, in-memory authentication client that simplifies testing and development of authentication-related features. It eliminates the need for external backend dependencies during development, offering immediate feedback and consistent behavior for your authentication logic, especially for complex scenarios like privileged logins.
